A Slow Python3 Implementation of Kuznyechik
═══════════════════════════════════════════
This is an unoptimised implementation of the Russian block cipher called
Kuznyechik which was standardised in 2015 as GOST 34.12-2015. Due to the
lack of optimisation, it is not suitable to be used in production. The only
reason for this implementation is testing and learning.
